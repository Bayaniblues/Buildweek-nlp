DS BUILD WEEK
------
By Cortez Ethridge

Natural Language Processing can help make sense 
of language data so we can make better decisions. The Weed Matics 
example takes the Kaggle dataset for Cannabis and searches for recommended strains
based off of desired Effects. Then this project was extended on a 
real world example to create Paulina's Gofundme description page.

Tokenizer separates a paragraph into a list, so the text can be easier 
to work with.  

TfidVectorizer builds our vocabulary and creates a feature matrix.

NearestNeighbor Takes our Vectorized object and gives us the ability to 
Search similar phrases. 

I hope that this build project can be a good example on how 
NLP can be used on real world projects.
